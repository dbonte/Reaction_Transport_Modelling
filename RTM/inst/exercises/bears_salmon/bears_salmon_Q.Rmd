# Questions

## Problem formulation

In previous lecture you made a foodweb model of salmon, bears, scavengers and salmon carcasses. 
You first created the conceptual model (flow diagram), then wrote the mass balance equations.

Now, you will create a rate expression for every flow that entered the mass balance equations. Once you have done that, you can see how this model is implemented in R.

## Mass balance equations

Suitable mass balances for the state variable SALMON, BEAR, CARCASS and SCAVENGERS are:

$$\frac{dSALMON}{dt} = Migration - BearFeeding - SalmonLoss$$
$$\frac{dBEAR}{dt} = BearFeeding-CarcassProd-BearLossIngest-BearLoss$$
$$\frac{dCARCASS}{dt} = CarcassProd -ScavFeeding - CarcassDecay$$
$$\frac{dSCAVENGERS}{dt} = ScavFeeding -ScavLossIngest - ScavLoss$$


## Assumptions

The assumptions are the following:

1.	The units of the state variables are in $kg~C~m^{-2}$; the time unit is in days. 
=> Question: What are the units of the flows?
2.	The model domain (river + surrounding area) is 1000*1000 metres large.
3.	The input of the salmon in the river is defined by a parameter called *migrate*. Per day, $10000~kg$ salmon Carbon migrate up the river. 
4.	The mortality + spawning + basal respiration of salmon, the hunting and basal respiration of the bear and the losses of the scavengers is expressed as a first-order rate.
5.	The parameters that you should use, and their values are:

|   parameter               | units	         | description                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|   area = 1000000          | [$m^2$]	       |                                                      | 
|   migrate = 10000         | [$kgC~d^{-1}$] | Amount of salmon entering the river system           | 
|   rSalmonLoss = 0.05      | [$d^{-1}$]	   | Salmon loss rate constant (Spawning+death+basalResp) | 
|   rBearFeeding = 0.02     | [$d^{-1}$]	   | Bear feeding rate constant                           | 
|   ksSalmon = 0.01         | [$kgC~m^{-2}$] | Half saturation ct for ingestion bear                | 
|   rBearLoss = 0.01/365    | [$d^{-1}$]	   | Death rate constant (hunting and other) for bear)    | 
|   pLossToCarcass = 0.5	  | [$-$]	         | Losses of salmon to carcass (fraction)               | 
|   pBearLossIngest = 0.4   | [$-$]	         | Ingested fraction that is lost (respiration+faeces)  | 
|   rCarcassDecay = 0.001   | [$d^{-1}$]	   | Decay rate constant of carcasses                     | 
|   rScavFeeding = 0.02     | [$d^{-1}$]	   | Feeding rate constant of scavengers                  | 
|   ksCarcass = 0.002       | [$kgC~m^{-2}$] | Half saturation ct for ingestion scavenger           | 
|   pScavLossIngest = 0.7   | [$-$]	         | Growth efficiency of scavengers                      | 
|   rScavLoss = 1/365       | [$d^{-1}$]	   | Mortality+basal respiration rate constant scavengers | 



## Tasks

The above is all the information you get. Write the mathematical equations for each flow on paper. 

Note: to make the equations (and the model code) readable, we use the following formalism: 

*	STATE VARIABLES are written in capitals, 
*	Flows start with a capital letter, and 
*	parameters start with lower case letter.

If you have finished with this exercise, then you can try to read, understand and then run the implementation of this model in R, using R markdown. 

It is in the file called *RiverRun_Rcode.Rmd*. 
The model is run twice, with different ingestion rates of the bears. 

* Try to explain the output of this model. 
* Assuming the mean weight of a bear at the start of the simulation is 300 $kg$, how many bears are there in the area? What is their final weight?
