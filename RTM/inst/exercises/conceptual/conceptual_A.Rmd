# Exercise 1 ANSWER. Lake biomanipulation.

![Conceptual scheme of the lake model.](images/conceptual_lake.png){width=70%}

* Possible forcing function could be f1, the inflow of DIP
* Suitable units: mol P $m^{-3}$
* The effects of biomanipulation can be investigated by changing f10.

# Exercise 2 ANSWER.	Bacterial decay of particulate organic matter in marine sediments.

![Conceptual scheme of the detritus model.](images/conceptual_detritus.png){width=70%}

Note the respiration that consists of two parts, basal respiration (a continuous process), and growth respiration (linked to bacterial growth).

# Exercise 3 ANSWER. Spread of the Corona virus. 

## Basic SIR model

## SIR model with vaccination

## SIR model with British variant

![Conceptual scheme of the SIR model including a new variant.](images/conceptual_SIR_variant.png){width=70%}

The assumptions are:

* immunity is gained for all variants whatever variant a person was infected with. 
* vaccination protects against all corona variants.


# Exercise 4 ANSWER.	Crops and weed.

![Conceptual scheme of the crop and weed model.](images/conceptual_crops.png){width=70%}

* fertilize once before planting can be implemented by increasing the initial concentratino of P in the upper layer
* fertilize regularly after planting is implemented as a flux (called *Paddition* in the scheme)
