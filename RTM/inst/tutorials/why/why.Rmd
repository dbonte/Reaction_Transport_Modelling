## Tutorial

You are advised to watch the introduction video first 

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJTbH2XoQN0&list=PLx8PHcDdmF-uD1Pr07TU9SzlhlGpfrxqn&index=2)

and/or read the following section of the book:
Soetaert and Herman, a practical guide to ecological modelling. Springer.

## Why modelling


```{r why_modelling, echo=FALSE}
question("Why do we develop scientific models?", type = "learnr_checkbox",
answer("they allow us to test our understanding of real systems", correct=TRUE),
answer("they allow us to extrapolate to larger spatial and temporal scales", correct=TRUE),
answer("they can guide empirical research", correct=TRUE),
answer("they allow us to invalidate empirical research", correct=FALSE),
answer("they allow us to test hypotheses", correct=FALSE),
answer("they allow us to generate hypotheses", correct=TRUE),
answer("because it is a lot of fun", correct=FALSE),

incorrect = "Modelling IS a lot of fun, but this is not our primary goal - we use models in addition to data gathering because it gives a different perspective of reality, it will increase our understanding, allows to extrapolate, it may guide our research and may be used to generate hypotheses",
correct = "Modelling IS a lot of fun, but this is not our primary goal - we use models in addition to data gathering because it gives a different perspective of reality, it will increase our understanding, allows to extrapolate, it may guide our research and may be used to generate hypotheses" 
  )
```

## Model focus

```{r Model_focus, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the focus of the models that we will develop in this course?", type = "learnr_checkbox",
 answer("Exchange of mass", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Exchange of energy", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Biogeochemical processes in cells", correct=FALSE),
 answer("Impact of biogeochemical processes on the environment", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Predicting of human impacts on the environment", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Predicting the weather", correct=FALSE),
 answer("Predicting stock markets", correct=FALSE),

  incorrect = "Although we can do all the things listed above with mechanistic models, in this course we restrict ourselves to exchanges of mass and energy and biogeochemistry/ecology relating to the environment",
  correct = "Although we can do all the things listed above with mechanistic models, in this course we restrict ourselves to exchanges of mass and energy and biogeochemistry/ecology relating to the environment")
```

## What will we do

```{r Course_do, echo=FALSE}
question("In this course we will", type = "learnr_checkbox",
 answer("Use existing models to generate predictions", correct=FALSE),
 answer("Create models to generate predictions", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Learn and practice how to write computer code", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Practice communication of model results", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Practice interpretation of model results", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Learn how to choose an appropriate existing model and let the computer do the work", correct=FALSE),   
 answer("Solve differential equations with pen and paper", correct=FALSE),
 answer("Learn how to formulate differential equations", correct=TRUE),
 incorrect = "This course is all about learning how to create a model, implement it, interprete it and communicate the results",
 correct = "This course is all about learning how to create a model, implement it, interprete it and communicate the results"
)
```

## Finally

```{r feedback, echo = FALSE}
question("give your feedback ", type = "learnr_text", answer(" ", correct=TRUE), correct="thank you", incorrect = "thank you")
```
