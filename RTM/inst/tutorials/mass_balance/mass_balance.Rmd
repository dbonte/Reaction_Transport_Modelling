## Mass balance of a lake ecosystem

Consider the conceptual diagram of a simple lake ecosystem model shown below. The state variables represent nitrogen (N) concentrations in the major lake compartments. Each state variable is in moles of N per cubic meter of water column, each flux is in moles of N per cubic meter of water column per day, water column height is h = 10 m.

## Biogeochemical reaction

Consider organic matter (OM) mineralization in a water column. Under anoxic conditions (no $O_2$ available), OM can be mineralized with nitrate ($NO_3^-$) as the electron acceptor (Denitrification). The corresponding stoichiometry of the reaction is given by the equation below, where 16/106 corresponds to the Redfield (molar) ratio of C:N in OM. 

$$
5CH_2O(NH_3)_{16/106}+4NO_3^-+4H^+ \rightarrow 5CO_2+7H_2O+2N_2+5(NH3)_{16/106}
$$

* Assume that the rate of OM mineralization is $R$, in units of $mol~C~m^{-3} h^{-1}$.
* Concentrations of OM and $CO_2$ are in $mol~C~m^{-3}$, concentrations of nitrate and ammonia are in $mol~N~m^{-3}$, and the concentration of dissolved $N_2$ gas is in $mol~N_2~m^{-3}$, where $m^3$ refers to the cubic meter of water column. Assume that OM mineralization is the only process in the system.

## Photosynthesis - conceptual model

Photosynthesis (PS) is a process used by plants to convert light energy into carbohydrates. In the first step, the photosystem II (PSII), enzymes capture photons of light that energize electrons and ultimately produce NADPH and ATP, the proton and energy source for the Calvin cycle that converts $CO_2$ into carbohydrates.

A simple representation of the PSII system considers three states: 

(1) an open or reactive PSII state, 
(2) a closed or activated state and 
(3) an inhibited state. 

After being hit by photons, the PSII transits from an open state to a closed one. The excited electrons are then transferred to the terminal electron acceptors, and the PSII system returns to the open state. Excessive absorption of light leads to photo-inhibition, that shifts the system from the closed to the inhibited state, from which it slowly recovers. 

![](images/PS.png)

In the scheme above, you find the three states that are used in this PS model. Based on the above description, draw the arrows that represent the transitions from each state to the other state.  If we define with *Fab* the transition rate from state a to b, then tick the boxes that should be added in this conceptual scheme:

```{r flows, echo=FALSE}
question("If Fab denotes the transition flow from state a to b, toggle the correct fluxes", type = "learnr_checkbox",
 answer("Foc", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Fco", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Foi"),
 answer("Fio"),
 answer("Fci", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Fic", correct=TRUE),
 incorrect = ("the transition flows are Foc, Fco, Fci an Fic")  
)
```

## Photosynthesis - mass balance

You are given the following conceptual diagram of the PSII model.
![](images/PS_MB.png)

* Write the mass balance equations for the state variables "[o]", "[c]" and "[i]":

```{r PS_MB, echo=FALSE}
question("Which of the following equations represent the balance equation for state 'c' ?", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("$\\frac{d[c]}{dt}=Foc-Fco+Fic-Fci$"), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("$\\frac{d[c]}{dt}=-Foc+Fco-Fic+Fci$")),
 answer(sprintf("$\\frac{d[c]}{dt}=Foc+Fco$"))
 )
```

## Photosynthesis - units

* The state variables "[o]", "[c]", "[i]" are fractions that sum to 1 (i.e. they are unitless). 

```{r PS_units, echo=FALSE}
question("If the time-unit in the model is 'second', what is the unit of the derivative $\\frac{d[i]}{dt}$ ", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("$s$")),
 answer(sprintf("$/s$"), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("$-$ (unitless)")),
incorrect = "the unit of a time-derivative = unit of the state variable per time",   
correct = "indeed: the unit of a time-derivative = unit of the state variable per time"
 )
```

* The rate expression for $F_{ic}$ is equal to 
$$F_{ic} = r \cdot [i]$$ 

```{r PSunitFic, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the unit of parameter $r$ ?", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("$s$")),
 answer(sprintf("$s^{-1}$"), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("$-$ (unitless)")),
 incorrect = sprintf("The unit of the flow $F_{ic}$ is $s^{-1}$, and [i] is unitless, hence $r$ has units of $s^{-1}$."),  
 correct = sprintf("The unit of the flow $F_{ic}$ is $s^{-1}$, and [i] is unitless, hence $r$ has units of $s^{-1}$.")  
 )
```

* The rate expression for $F_{oc}$ is equal to 
$$F_{oc} =\sigma \cdot I \cdot [o],$$ 
where the unit of $I$ (light) is $\mu$ mol photons $m^{-2} s^{-1}$. 

```{r psunitfoc, echo=FALSE}
question("What is the unit of parameter $\\sigma$", type = "learnr_radio",
 answer(sprintf("$s$")),
 answer(sprintf("$m^2 (\\mu mol~photons) ^{-1}$"), correct=TRUE),
 answer(sprintf("$s^{-1}$")),
 answer(sprintf("$\\mu mol~photons ~s^{-1}$")),
 incorrect = sprintf("The unit of the flow $F_{oc}$ is $s^{-1}$, and $I \\cdot [o]$ has units of $\\mu$ mol photons $m^{-2} s^{-1}$. To obtain unit of $s^{-1}$, $\\sigma$ must be expressed in $m^2 (\\mu$ mol photons) $^{-1}$ (The parameter $\\sigma$ is called the absorption cross section of PSII)."),  
 correct = sprintf("The unit of the flow $F_{oc}$ is $s^{-1}$, and $I \\cdot [o]$ has units of $\\mu$ mol photons $m^{-2} s^{-1}$. To obtain unit of $s^{-1}$, $\\sigma$ must be expressed in $m^2 (\\mu$ mol photons) $^{-1}$ (The parameter $\\sigma$ is called the absorption cross section of PSII).")

```




## Finally

```{r feedback, echo = FALSE}
question("give your feedback ", type = "learnr_text", answer(" ", correct=TRUE), correct="thank you", incorrect = "thank you")
```
